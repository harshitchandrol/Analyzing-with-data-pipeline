# Analyzing-with-data-pipeline

# Goals for this Project:
## Build an optimal model on Boston Housing Dataset [from skelarn dataset library], so it can be used in deployement to score on new labelled data

##Plan and the learning goal
- Data Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Train test split 
- classification and a regression pipeline
- grid search 3 fold cross validation 
- using atleast 7 different models
- Hyperparameter tuning in pipeline
- multiple appropriate scoring metrics, cross validation metric
- Evaluation
- check the model on the entire data
